Steps to run:
1. Place driver.py and log_parser.py in to an empty folder
2. Open and run the driver.py script

   a. Place both the AID and AWLU log zip files in to the ZippedLogs folder that was created
   b. Ensure that there is a backup of these zips
4. The script should run successfully and output an excel file in the folder with the scripts

Notes:
There are a few edge cases which will cause errors.
It's common for AWLU log files to have less information in them sometimes resulting in a blank graph.
